Google search results consider the amount of links to a particular result. This means that if an article is shared millions of times it will be ranked higher than another that was shared less. This leads to confirmation bias, where people believe information just because it is shared around or because they heard others mention it. 

It's important to question the masses and realise that the algorithms that we use today often consider what is popular at the time to increase user engagement.

Subvert the algorithm, go against the grain and challenge common concepts.
