Services such as Google compute language and grammar used in queries to serve results. Just through the words you use in a search query the results could be wildly different. For example, if I Google search "Did the moon landing happen?" I get given results which align more to conspiracy theories and hoaxes. However, if I were to search for "Moon landing" the results I receive are completely different.

By taking this a step further and changing the language you use in a search query, the results you are served will be curated differently mainly due to relevance. On top of this, ads that are targeted to you will begin to change - again, due to relevance.

So if you know another language, why not use it to trick those pesky algorithms.

Subvert the algorithm, source information in another language.
