Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are the four tech giants. They dominate the tech space from hardware to software. Your data is extremely valuable to them, because the more they know about you the better they can target you to use their products. It's often hard to stray from these companies as they control many products you may enjoy using. If it is possible to use an alternative, it is strongly recommended.

Perhaps when giving your data consider what is really necessary to share with the company, and ultimately the world.

Can you use fake credentials or birthdates etc.?
