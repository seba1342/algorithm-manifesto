Be aware that algorithms target information to you. The Facebook newsfeed is a culprit of echo chambering your beliefs. This effect can lead to you only reading what you already know/believe - which leads to confirmation bias. Be aware that algorithms serve you content that is aligned with your beliefs as it is the most engaging and relatable.

By seeking alternate perspectives you will also engage in new information, which will inevitably lead to an increase in your own knowledge.

Subvert the algorithm by going out of your way to understand opposing perspectives.
