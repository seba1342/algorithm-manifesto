The infamous 'walled garden' that Apple supplies to its customers is a luxury. The convenience of all your data being synced in the cloud, across all of your devices is often enough to forget about the prying eyes that make this convenience possible.

This convenience will often come at the cost of your privacy. You need to ask yourself is the convenience you're getting from these services enough to sacrifice your privacy? This information is used to train their algorithms to curate the content they will then feed you. The database of information they have on their customers helps them build targeted products, advertisement and services.

It's often a nuisance to intentionally try and not to get locked into a single ecosystem. The best way to do this is to use services provided by different companies. For example: use an outlook.com email from Microsoft, cloud storage from Google and messaging from iMessage by Apple.  

Subvert the algorithm and don't get locked into a single ecosystem.
