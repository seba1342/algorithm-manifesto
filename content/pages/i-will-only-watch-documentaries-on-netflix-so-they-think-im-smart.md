Netflix recommends shows based on what you watch and how long you watch it for. Their algorithm is pretty accurate too. Why not let it work in your favour and make them think you're smart at the same time. Click on documentaries and Netflix will serve you more. Then if the FBI ever ask for your Netflix recommendations they'll think you're a genius. 

On top of this, you'll be served content to binge that will give you more knowledge. And everyone knows that knowledge is power.

Subvert the algorithm, watch more docos.
