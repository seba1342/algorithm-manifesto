Duckduckgo is a search engine that doesn't track you. Contrary to Google, Duckduckgo doesn't track your searches, provide targetted advertisement or store your personal information. In a world where your data seems to be up for grabs by every service you use this is a refreshing product. You can easily install duckduckgo as a chrome extension, or on your other browsers.
